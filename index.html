            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              In this project, I will be analyzing 5 million simulated hands of
              Blackjack. I will go over my process for transforming and loading
              the data, as well as share my findings from these games.

            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>
              My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of Blackjack strategies,
              odds, and outcomes. By exploring these statisitics, I will be able
              to make a determination on which values are good/bad for the
              player/dealer. I will be exploring these questions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Which dealer's face up card has the greatest winning percentage?
              </li>
              <li>
                Which player's starting hand has the greatest winning
                percentage?
              </li>
              <li>
                Which player's ending total has the greatest winning percentage?
              </li>
              <li>
                What kind of win/loss ratio can we expect from a player who uses
                basic strategy?
              </li>

            <h2>Dataset</h2>
            <p>
              Originally, I wanted to create my own Python script to simulate a
              number of hands of Blackjack. However, as I am focusing more on
              the analysis aspect, I opted to instead explore Kaggle for
              accessible datasets. I found a dataset that contained 50 million
              simulated hands of Blackjack. Here is the link to the dataset:
              <a
                href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dennisho/blackjack-hands/data"
                target="_blank"
                >50 Million Hands of Blackjack</a
              >. There were several columns, but I focused only on these:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                dealer_up (<i><b>int</b> - dealer's initial face up card</i>)
              </li>
              <li>
                initial_hand (<i
                  ><b>list[ ]</b> - the player's initial two cards</i
                >)
              </li>
              <li>
                dealer_final (<i><b>list[ ]</b> - the dealer's final cards</i>)
              </li>
              <li>
                dealer_final_value (<i
                  ><b>int</b> - the dealer's total ending value</i
                >)
              </li>
              <li>
                player_final (<i><b>list[ ][ ]</b> - the player's final cards</i
                >)
              </li>
              <li>
                player_final_value (<i
                  ><b>int</b> - the player's total ending value</i
                >)
              </li>
              <li>
                actions_taken (<i
                  ><b>list[ ][ ]</b> - the action's taken by the player</i
                >)
              </li>
              <li>
                win (<i
                  ><b>float</b> - the multiplier of the player's initial bet</i
                >)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This data was simulated using the most common set of rules in Las
              Vegas casinos. More information can be found on the Kaggle page.

            <h2>Data Modeling / Database Design</h2>
            <p>
              I planned on loading the .csv file straight into PowerBI, but I
              had worries concerning how large this dataset was. The .csv was
              almost 4GB large containing over 50 million rows. I decided to go
              with a more scalable approach and loaded the data into a
              PostgreSQL database, a common industry choice. Utilizing
              PostgreSQL's <b>/COPY</b> command to load the data into the
              database was the most efficient way to do this. The was a much
              faster approach rather than using Python to write to the database.
            </p>
            <p>The data in the .csv looked like this:</p>
            <table class="full-table">
              <tr>
                <th>dealer_up</th>
                <th>initial_hand</th>
                <th>dealer_final</th>
                <th>dealer_final_value</th>
                <th>player_final</th>
                <th>player_final_value</th>
                <th>actions_taken</th>
                <th>win</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>6</td>
                <td>[3, 3]</td>
                <td>[6, 10, 10]</td>
                <td>26</td>
                <td>[[3, 2, 10], [3, 4, 5]]</td>
                <td>[15, 12]</td>
                <td>[['P', 'H', 'S'], ['H', 'S']]</td>
                <td>2</td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            <p>
              The more I started to plan how my schema would look, the more I
              realized it was not going to be as simple as writing each row to
              the database. The main issue was the nested lists in the
              player_final and actions_taken columns. It would be difficult to
              analyze the data in PowerBI, so I had to normalize my database. I
              split the data into 4 tables:
              <b>dealer</b>, <b>player</b>, <b>player_start</b>, and
              <b>round</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using dbdiagram.io, I was able to create a quick database schema
              diagram to plan out my tables. Creating the PostgreSQL database
              can be found within a

              The information is now usable in PowerBI with the sample data
              looking like this in the database:

              Now the data from the original .csv must be transformed in order
              to be able to load it properly in the PostgreSQL database.

            <h2>Transformation</h2>
            <p>
              I will use Python / Pandas in order to transform the data. The
              original .csv will be split up into four different .csv files,
              each one being related to their respective table. The
              <a

              >
              can be found in the project's repository. The only thing to note
              within the script is changing the "[" and "]" to "{" and "}"
              respectively. This is because PostgreSQL takes in arrays in the
              form of "{" and "}".

                  According to the chart above, players going against a dealer's
                  cards 3-6 have more than a 50% chance of winning. These
                  low-value cards are the most favorable for the player as the
                  chances of the dealer busting are higher. Since the dealer
                  must hit if they have 16 or less, showing a 6 has the highest
                  winning percentage. Assuming the dealer has a 10 face-down,
                  them hitting and getting a card 6 or higher will bust them.
                  Players seeing one of these face-up cards should be more
                  aggressive in their play knowing these odds are in their

                  Players should not only take a look at their hand, but also
                  consider their hand in regards to the dealer. A combination of
                  the information shown in the previous chart as well as the
                  information directly above should further help shift the odds
                  in the player's favor. The chart above shows that players with
                  hands of high value, (e.g., 10/A, 10/10, 10/9) have the
                  highest winning percentage. These hands are the most favorable
                  for the player as they are close to 21. It then shifts to
                  hands that have a high chance of being close to 21 after a
                  hit: 11, 10, AA (<i>after being split</i>), and 9. Using basic
                  strategy, players must assume the next card they hit will be a
                  10, explaining why these hands are the most favorable. These
                  hands must be played aggressively the odds are in the player's
                  favor.

                  Using the most commonly played Las Vegas rule set, players who
                  get blackjack off of their starting hand has to wait until the
                  dealer confirms they do not have blackjack as well. If they
                  do, it is a push, indicating no win or loss.

                  Similar to the previous chart, we can see that players ending
                  on 19-21 have the highest chance to win with 18 also being a
                  valuable total. We can see here that although 17 is a high
                  number, it is beaten by values 12-14. This is because a hard
                  17 has a high chance of busting if the player hits. Players
                  with 12-14 have a higher chance of hitting and getting a card
                  that will not bust them. Only cards 8 and higher will make the
                  player bust. Players with 17 should play more conservatively
                  as the odds are not in their favor. With values 12-14, players
                  can play more aggressively as the odds are in their favor.

                  Even after reviewing all the best strategies, numbers, and
                  hands to play, the chart above shows the unfortunate outcomes
                  a player will be faced with. Out of 5 million hands, ~50% of
                  the games played will result in a loss, ~42% of games will
                  result in a win, and ~8% will result in a tie.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              By players using basic strategy, we can see the odds of winning
              are increased. Players should play aggressively when their initial
              cards total to 19-21 and when the dealer is showing low-value
              cards like 3-6. After doing a deep dive into this topic, we can
              see that players who decide to play should be aware that the odds
              are already not in their favor, no matter how well they play. The
              house always wins in the end with a 50% win rate. Discouraging as
              this may be, gambling should be done for fun and players should
              enjoy to play the game regardless of the outcome. Some players may
              even beat the odds and get lucky!

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
              I chose this topic as it was something I had an interest in. The
              biggest areas of work that I had to focus on during this project
              were the data modeling and database design. A database was
              required in order for this project to be scalable and efficient so
              I spent a lot of time making sure my schema was correct. This
              project helped me work on those database skills as well as giving
              me more practice using Pandas and PowerBI. If I were to restart
              this project, I would definitely look into creating my own
              blackjack simulator in order to create the correct dataset I need
              right away. I look forward to polishing this project even further,
              diving deeper into the dataset and answering more in-depth
              technical blackjack questions.
